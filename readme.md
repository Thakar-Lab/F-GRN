F-GRN implements fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm to identify functionally related genes (gene-sets). F-GRN is developed in Matlab as an installable package. F-GRN allows user to identify gene signatures in human monocyte derived dendritic cell responsive to influenza infection. This interactive package is developed by Thakar Lab located at the University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York. For futher information regarding F-GRN, please contact:

 ================================
 
 
 Files required for running F-GRN package:
 
 
 -F_GRN.exe
 
 -MCRInstaller.exe  (to be downloaded from internet automatically during the installation). 

  NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run F-GRN. 





Prerequisites for running F-GRN: 


1. If you have Matlab installed: 


   Verify the MATLAB Runtime is installed and ensure you    
   have installed version 9.0.1 (R2016a).   

   If the MATLAB Runtime is not installed, do the following:
   
   (a) enter
  
       mcrinstaller
      
      at MATLAB prompt. The MCRINSTALLER command displays the 
      location of the MATLAB Runtime installer.

   (b) run the MATLAB Runtime installer.
   
   

2.  If you do not have Matlab: 
   

   For convenience, Matlab Runtime compiler has been embedded with F-GRN as a single package that installs both FGRN and Matlab
   compiler. (No further download/installation is needed for Matlab compiler). 

   During the installation of F-GRN, you will be automatically redirected to Matlab server for downloading and installation of
   Windows 64-bit version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2016a from the MathWorks Web site.
   
   Please be patient during the installation process as it may take several minutes depending on your speed and connection. 
   Matlab Runtime compiler is about ~900Mb in size that is downloaded and installed during the installation of 'F-GRN.exe'.     

   
    For more information about the MATLAB Runtime and the MATLAB Runtime installer, 
    see Package and Distribute in the MATLAB Compiler documentation in the MathWorks Documentation Center.
